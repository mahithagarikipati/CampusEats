## Project Introduction
The idea of this project is to understand and enhance a test database for a campus-controlled food delivery service like craveoncampus.com. This database is enhanced to provide rating system for both restaurants and delivery drivers. The purpose for having this system is due the threat of the Corona virus the reason for having food delivery services became more important than before. 

Local restaurants are usually eager to find ways to provide food to customers without having to hire employees for delivery. Experts predict that, even if things get back to normal, people will get used to food delivery and will continue ordering their food that way. And, itâ€™s a known fact that students love to get their food delivered through the services on campus. Although, companies like UberEats, GrubHub deliver food to students on campus, schools however feel that they should take control of this delivery, in order to ensure that students or authorized university employees are the only ones delivering food on campus for safety and health reasons. With the enhancement of this existing test database, students will be able to get the rating for the restaurants as well as their delivery drivers.
